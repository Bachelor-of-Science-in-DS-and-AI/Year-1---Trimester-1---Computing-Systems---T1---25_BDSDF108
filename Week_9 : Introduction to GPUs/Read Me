Module Description
This module introduces GPUs  as co-processors, and the GPGPU architecture.

Learning Objectives 
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the architecture of GPUs and how they differ from CPUs
- Understand and articulate - qualitatively - how parallel execution works in GPUs
- Estimate performance of a multi-threaded program in a given GPU
- (Re-)structure a given program for high performance parallel execution in a GPU
