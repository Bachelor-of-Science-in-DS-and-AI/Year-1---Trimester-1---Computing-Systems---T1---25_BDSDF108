# Year 1 - Trimester 1 - Computing Systems T1_25_BDSDF108

<b> Course Introduction </b>

✅ Course Description

This introductory course provides a cross-sectional understanding of Computing Systems from a bottom-up perspective - starting with the hardware components of a stand-alone computer, the software (i.e. Operating Systems and virtual environments) that manage such hardware and enable execution of other software (i.e. programs), leading towards the supporting landscape of systems for a high-level programmer (source code repositories, profilers and debuggers, co-processors for offloading niche computation, mobile/embedded computers) and concluding with large-scale computing systems (distributed systems and Cloud Computing).

✅ Learning Outcomes
  - Explain the components - along with their functions - of a computing system/environment.
  - Structure a program so as to leverage the operating system and the execution environment.
  - Design an execution-level modularization of a program to obtain performance using threads, processor cores and GPUs, as well as nodes in a distributed system.
  - Build software by using the development environment's tools (run-time, debugger, profiler, repository, and versioning).
  - Select and fit an execution environment to deploy an application program.
