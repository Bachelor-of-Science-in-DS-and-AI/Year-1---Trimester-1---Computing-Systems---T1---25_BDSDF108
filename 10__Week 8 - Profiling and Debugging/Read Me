Module Description:
This module introduces the concepts of profiling a program at run-time and debugging it using typical dynamic profilers and debuggers.

Module-level Learning Objectives: 
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand and articulate the difference between static (as in compile-time) vs. dynamic (as in run-time)
- Profile a reasonably complex program using a profiler
- Debug a reasonably complex program using a debugger
