# Module Description

This module introduces learners to the fundamental concepts of computing Systems. It covers the components of computers - both hardware and software. It also discusses different architectural models like Von-Neumann, Harvard and Modified Harvard architectures. 

- Learning Outcomes

  By the end of this module, you will be able to: 

  - Understand different components of a computer and what the Stored Program concept means.
  - Based on the components and their interconnections, how various architectures like Von-Neumann, Harvard and Modified Harvard can be designed.
  - How these architectures fit with various architectural models like Single cycle, multi-cycle and pipelined architectures.
  - What are the main diffences between the different Intel families of  processors (13, 15, 17 and i9)
