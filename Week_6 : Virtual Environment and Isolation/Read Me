Module Description

This module introduces the concept of virtuaization, illustrates the concepts with examples at different levels and highlights a commonly used models
of  virtualization. The module starts by differentiating between abstraction and virtualization, introduces notions of physical vs virtual resources 
as well as physical vs interfaces and how these manifest in the context of computer systems. Classification of virtual environments as process virtual 
machines and system virtual machines is explained along with their primary function of isolation. High-level Language Virtual Machines as a special case 
of Process Virtual Machines, and Python Virtual Environment as an example of the same are explained further. Containers as light-weight System Virtual 
Machines are introduced.            

Module-level Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the difference between abstraction and virtualization,
- Argue that a given virtual environment is of a particular kind, and
- Run Language Virtual Machines and Containers on your desktop/laptop computers for specific purposes.
