Module Description
This module covers the difference between Program and Process. It also covers light weight process (threads) and its merits compared to conventional 
processes. The module also discusses about the mapping between user level and kernel level. Data sharing across multiple processes / threads will also 
be discussed. It also covers the performance optimization techniques like thread pools and zeroed out threads. Basic issues related to data concurrency 
and sharing (synchronization) will also be discussed.            

Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand Process model with a clear distinction between Program and Process.
- Understand Threads (both user level and kernel level), their concurrency and data sharing.
- Improve performance by incorporating optimization techniques like maintaining thread pools and managing zeroed out threads.
- Understand various concurrency related issues and how to resolve them with minimum overhead.
